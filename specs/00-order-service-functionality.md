# Feature Specification: Order Service Core Functionality

**Feature Branch**: `00-order-service-functionality`  
**Created**: 2026-01-14  
**Status**: Documentation  
**Purpose**: Document existing order service functionality including user management, product catalog, and order workflow

**Project Context:**
- Technology: Go 1.25.5
- Service Name: order-service
- Architecture: Standard Go project layout with HTTP API
- External Dependencies: 
  - Product Service (via PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL)

## Overview

This specification documents the existing functionality of the Order Service, a Go HTTP API server demonstrating e-commerce order management. The service follows a contract-first approach with OpenAPI specification and implements order workflow features with integration to external Product Service and Loyalty Service.

**Current Implementation Status**: 
- Order CRUD operations: ✅ Implemented
- Product Service integration: ✅ Implemented (2026-01-14)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - List All Orders (Priority: P1)

As an admin user, I need to retrieve a list of all orders in the system so that I can monitor order activity and status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system has multiple orders, **When** requesting GET /orders with valid authentication, **Then** the system returns all orders with total count
2. **Given** the system has no orders, **When** requesting GET /orders, **Then** the system returns an empty orders array with total count of 0
3. **Given** no authentication token is provided, **When** requesting GET /orders, **Then** the system returns 401 Unauthorized
4. **Given** an invalid authentication token, **When** requesting GET /orders, **Then** the system returns 401 Unauthorized

---

### User Story 2 - Retrieve Order by ID (Priority: P1)

As an admin user, I need to retrieve a specific order by its ID so that I can view detailed order information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid orderId exists, **When** requesting GET /orders/{orderId} with valid authentication, **Then** the system returns the complete order details including products, prices, and status
2. **Given** an orderId does not exist, **When** requesting GET /orders/{orderId}, **Then** the system returns 404 ORDER_NOT_FOUND
3. **Given** an invalid UUID format for orderId, **When** requesting GET /orders/{orderId}, **Then** the system returns 400 INVALID_ORDER_ID with validation error
4. **Given** no authentication token is provided, **When** requesting GET /orders/{orderId}, **Then** the system returns 401 Unauthorized

---

### User Story 3 - Create Order with Product Validation (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create an order with products from the catalog so that I can purchase items, and the system should validate that all products exist in the Product Service.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid userId and valid productIds from Product Service, **When** creating an order via POST /orders, **Then** the system validates products with Product Service, calculates total price using actual product prices, and creates the order in PENDING status
2. **Given** a valid userId but one or more invalid productIds, **When** creating an order, **Then** the system queries Product Service, detects invalid products, and returns 400 BAD_REQUEST with details about which products are invalid
3. **Given** missing or empty userId, **When** creating an order, **Then** the system returns 400 MISSING_USER_ID
4. **Given** invalid userId format (not a UUID), **When** creating an order, **Then** the system returns 400 INVALID_USER_ID
5. **Given** empty products array, **When** creating an order, **Then** the system returns 400 EMPTY_PRODUCTS
6. **Given** products with quantity < 1, **When** creating an order, **Then** the system returns 400 with validation error
7. **Given** Product Service is unavailable, **When** creating an order, **Then** the system returns 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE with details about Product Service unavailability
8. **Given** no authentication token is provided, **When** creating an order, **Then** the system returns 401 Unauthorized

**Product Service Integration**:
- System MUST call Product Service GET /products/{id} for each productId to validate existence
- System MUST use actual product prices from Product Service for total price calculation
- System MUST handle Product Service failures gracefully (timeouts, 404s, 500s)

---

### User Story 4 - Order Modification with Product Revalidation (Priority: P2)

As a user with a pending order, I want to update the products and quantities in my order so that I can adjust my purchase before submission, and the system should validate any new products against the Product Service.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PENDING order, **When** patching with positive quantities for existing products, **Then** the system adds to existing quantities (additive) and recalculates total price
2. **Given** a PENDING order, **When** patching with positive quantities for new productIds, **Then** the system validates the new products with Product Service, adds them to the order, and recalculates total price
3. **Given** a PENDING order, **When** patching with negative quantities, **Then** the system subtracts from existing quantities (subtractive), removes products if result ≤ 0, and recalculates total price
4. **Given** a PENDING order, **When** patching with quantity 0, **Then** no change is made to that product
5. **Given** a PENDING order, **When** patching with invalid productIds, **Then** the system validates with Product Service and returns 400 BAD_REQUEST for invalid products
6. **Given** a non-PENDING order (processing, shipped, delivered), **When** attempting to patch, **Then** the system returns 400 error with code "ORDER_NOT_PENDING"
7. **Given** Product Service is unavailable, **When** patching an order with new products, **Then** the system returns 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE

**Product Service Integration**:
- System MUST validate any new productIds added via PATCH against Product Service
- System MUST recalculate order total using actual Product Service prices
- System MUST NOT allow adding products that don't exist in Product Service

---

### User Story 5 - Order Submission (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to submit my order for processing so that it can be fulfilled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PENDING order, **When** submitting the order via POST /orders/{orderId}/submit, **Then** the system changes status to PROCESSING
2. **Given** a PENDING order, **When** submitting with action=cancel, **Then** the system changes status to CANCELLED
3. **Given** a non-PENDING order, **When** attempting to submit, **Then** the system returns 400 error with code "ORDER_NOT_PENDING"

---

### User Story 6 - Authentication and Security (Priority: P1)

As a system, I need to authenticate all API requests to ensure secure access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid Bearer token (20+ characters for development), **When** making an API request, **Then** the request is processed
2. **Given** no Bearer token, **When** making an API request to protected endpoint, **Then** the system returns 401 Unauthorized
3. **Given** an invalid or short token, **When** making an API request, **Then** the system returns 401 Unauthorized

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when concurrent updates are made to the same order?
- How does the system handle product price changes after an order is created but before submission?
- What happens if Product Service is unavailable during order creation?
- What happens if Product Service is unavailable during order modification?
- How does the system handle extremely large order quantities?
- What happens if Product Service returns inconsistent pricing between order creation and modification?
- What happens if a product becomes unavailable after being added to an order?
- How does the system handle timeouts when calling Product Service?
- What happens if Product Service returns a product price change while calculating order totals?

### External Service Integration

#### Product Service
- **Environment Variable**: `PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL` (e.g., `http://product-service:8200`)
- **Purpose**: Validate products and retrieve pricing information
- **Current Status**: 🔄 Placeholder logic exists, needs implementation
- **Required Calls**:
  - `GET /products` - List all products (no auth)
  - `GET /products/{id}` - Get product details with price (requires auth)
- **Implementation Location**: `internal/services/order_service.go`
- **TODOs in Code**:
  ```go
  // TODO: Integrate with PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL to fetch actual product prices
  // TODO: Integrate with PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL to validate products
  ```



### Data Models

#### Order (models.Order)
```go
type Order struct {
    ID          string         // UUID format
    Products    []OrderProduct
    TotalPrice  float64
    OrderDate   time.Time
    Status      OrderStatus    // PENDING, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED
}
```

#### OrderProduct (models.OrderProduct)
```go
type OrderProduct struct {
    ProductID    string  // UUID format - must exist in Product Service
    ProductName  string  // Fetched from Product Service
    Quantity     int     // Must be > 0 for creation, can be negative for PATCH
    Price        float64 // Fetched from Product Service
}
```

#### OrderStatus (models.OrderStatus)
```go
type OrderStatus string

const (
    OrderStatusPending    OrderStatus = "PENDING"
    OrderStatusProcessing OrderStatus = "PROCESSING"
    OrderStatusShipped    OrderStatus = "SHIPPED"
    OrderStatusDelivered  OrderStatus = "DELIVERED"
    OrderStatusCanceled   OrderStatus = "CANCELLED"
)
```

#### ErrorResponse (models.ErrorResponse)
```go
type ErrorResponse struct {
    Code    string // Error code identifier (e.g., "ORDER_NOT_FOUND", "INVALID_ORDER_ID")
    Message string // Human-readable error message
    Details string // Additional context or technical details
}
```

#### Product (external - from Product Service)
```typescript
interface Product {
    id: number           // Product Service uses numeric IDs
    name: string
    description: string
    price: number
    availability: boolean
}
```

#### API Request/Response Models

**POST /orders Request Body**:
```json
{
  "userId": "750e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "products": [
    {
      "productId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

**GET /orders Response**:
```json
{
  "orders": [Order, Order, ...],
  "total": 10
}
```

**PATCH /orders/{orderId} Request Body**:
```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "productId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "quantity": 2     // positive = add, negative = subtract, 0 = no change
    }
  ]
}
```

**POST /orders/{orderId}/submit Request Body** (optional):
```json
{
  "action": "cancel"   // If present, cancels order instead of submitting
}
```

### Business Logic

#### Order Update Logic (PATCH /orders/{orderId})
Only PENDING orders can be modified. For each product in the PATCH request:

1. **Positive quantity** (`quantity > 0`):
   - If product exists in order: Add to existing quantity (additive)
   - If product is new: Validate against Product Service, then add to order

2. **Negative quantity** (`quantity < 0`):
   - If product exists: Subtract from existing quantity (subtractive)
   - If result ≤ 0: Remove product from order
   - If product doesn't exist: Ignore (no error)

3. **Zero quantity** (`quantity = 0`):
   - No change made (ignore)

After modifications:
- Recalculate total price using Product Service prices

#### Order Status Workflow

**Valid Status Transitions**:
```
PENDING → PROCESSING  (via submit)
PENDING → CANCELLED   (via submit with action=cancel)
PROCESSING → SHIPPED  (manual/future implementation)
SHIPPED → DELIVERED   (manual/future implementation)
```

**Business Rules**:
- Only PENDING orders can be modified (PATCH)
- Only PENDING orders can be submitted
- Orders transition to PROCESSING status on successful submission
- Cancelled orders remain in CANCELLED status

#### Product Validation Flow (Order Creation)

```
1. Receive POST /orders with userId and products[]
2. Validate userId format (UUID)
3. Validate products array not empty
4. For each product:
   a. Call Product Service GET /products/{productId}
   b. If 404: Return error "Product {id} not found"
   c. If 200: Extract price from response
   d. Calculate line total: price × quantity
5. Sum all line totals = order total price
6. Create order with PENDING status
7. Return created order
```

#### Product Validation Flow (Order Modification)

```
1. Receive PATCH /orders/{orderId} with products[]
2. Verify order exists and status is PENDING
3. For each product with positive quantity (new products):
   a. Call Product Service GET /products/{productId}
   b. If 404: Return error "Product {id} not found"
   c. If 200: Extract price from response
4. Apply additive/subtractive logic
5. Recalculate total price using Product Service
6. Return updated order
```

#### Error Handling Strategy

**Product Service Errors**:
- 404 Not Found → Return 400 BAD_REQUEST to client with "Product {id} not found"
- 500 Server Error → Return 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE with "Product Service unavailable"
- Timeout → Return 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE with "Product Service timeout"
- Connection Refused → Return 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE with "Product Service unreachable"

**Validation Errors** → Return 400 BAD_REQUEST with specific error codes:
- MISSING_USER_ID
- INVALID_USER_ID
- EMPTY_PRODUCTS
- INVALID_ORDER_ID
- ORDER_NOT_FOUND
- ORDER_NOT_PENDING
- INVALID_PRODUCT_ID

### Docker Compose (Multi-Service)
```bash
cd dev
docker-compose up -d
```

The docker-compose configuration:
- **order-service**: port 8100
- **product-service**: port 8200

## Future Considerations

### Immediate Next Steps (Implementation TODOs)
1. **Product Service Integration** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Implement product validation in CreateOrder
   - Implement product validation in UpdateOrderProducts
   - Fetch real product prices instead of placeholders
   - Add timeout and error handling
   - Add retry logic for transient failures

2. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Add Product Service mock for unit tests
   - Add contract tests for Product Service
   - Add integration tests with real Product Service

### Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)
- **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory mock storage with PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **Real Authentication**: Implement OAuth2/JWT with proper token validation
- **User Service Integration**: Validate userId against User Service
- **Inventory Management**: Check product availability before order creation
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate payment gateway for order submission
- **Order Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications for status changes
- **Order History & Analytics**: Track order metrics and trends
- **Shipping Integration**: Real-time shipping status tracking
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect API from abuse
- **API Versioning**: Support multiple API versions
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support multiple organizations/tenants
- **GraphQL API**: Alternative to REST for flexible data fetching
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time order status updates
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Publish order events for other services
